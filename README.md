# Codebank


<!-- What is it? Why did I do it? What I learned -->
Codebank is a showcase of the most popular and well known cyphers, including Morse code and the Caesar cypher. The site also includes functioning live encoders and decoders for each cypher which is implemented using JavaScript. This was a project for my second year of university and I was my first experience with JavaScript. I also took a lot of care to make sure the website was responsive.

The site can be viewed [here](https://alexjhill.github.io/codebank/index.html).
